# Code Refactor Starter Code
Description
This README document outlines the accessibility standards adhered to in the project, ensuring semantic HTML, logical structure, accessible images, sequential headings, and a descriptive title.

Accessibility Standards
Semantic HTML Elements
The webpage utilizes semantic HTML elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.) to structure content.
Logical Structure
HTML elements are organized in a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation for users.
Accessible Alt Attributes
Image elements (<img>) include descriptive and meaningful alt attributes that provide context about the image content.
Sequential Heading Attributes
Heading elements (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.) are used in sequential order to properly structure content hierarchy.
Descriptive Title Element
The <title> element in the <head> section of each HTML page is concise and accurately describes the content of the webpage.
